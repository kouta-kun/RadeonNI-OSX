Dated log of experiments: what was tried, what was observed, what was
concluded. Negative results are recorded too. Newest entry last.

## 2026-10-04 — Host inventory; the HD 7570 is not on the PCI bus

**Tried.** Read-only inspection of the host (`scripts/host-inventory.sh`
reproduces it): os-release, kernel cmdline and config, `lspci -nnvv`, `lspci
-tv`, IOMMU groups, dmesg, loaded modules, DMI, installed tools.

**Observed.**

- Arch Linux, kernel 6.18.50-2-lts, MSI X370 KRAIT GAMING (MS-7A33), BIOS 1.L8
  (2024-08-30), Ryzen 5 5600G, 27 GiB RAM, 331 GB free on `/`. Uptime 2 days.
- AMD-Vi is enabled with interrupt remapping; 19 IOMMU groups; default domain
  type "Translated". No kernel parameters were needed for that.
- The only display controller is the 5600G's integrated GPU, `30:00.0`
  `1002:1638` (Cezanne), driver `amdgpu`, `boot_vga=1`, IOMMU group 11.
- No device with a Turks or Redwood ID exists. No `1002:aa90`-style HDMI audio
  function either. `radeon` is not loaded.
- The CPU's x16 slot hangs off root port `00:01.1`. That function does not
  respond to config reads (`setpci -s 00:01.1 0.l` selects nothing); only the
  dummy host bridge `00:01.0` is there. On this platform the GPP bridge is
  hidden when no link trained at boot.
- The chipset's downstream ports with nothing behind them (`20:00.0`,
  `20:02.0`, `20:03.0`, `20:04.0`) all report `PresDet-`.
- The DMI slot table is boilerplate (Intel-style bus addresses) and says
  nothing useful.
- Kernel has `CONFIG_MMIOTRACE=y`, `CONFIG_VFIO_PCI=m`, `CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m`,
  `CONFIG_VFIO_NOIOMMU` unset. `TURKS_{mc,me,pfp,smc}.bin.zst` are present in
  `/lib/firmware/radeon`.
- QEMU: only `qemu-base 11.1.1-1` (x86 system emulator and `qemu-img`). No
  `qemu-system-ppc`, no `qemu-ppc` user emulator, no PowerPC cross compiler,
  no clang. Arch's repos have `qemu-system-ppc` and `qemu-user-static`
  11.1.1-4 but no `powerpc-linux-gnu-gcc`.
- No display manager or graphical session; the host is used over ssh. Passwordless
  sudo is available.

**Concluded.**

- The card is not installed, not seated, not powered, or dead. Milestone 0
  cannot start until it enumerates. This needs the user physically, and a
  power-off of the host.
- IOMMU grouping constrains which slot is usable: everything behind the X370
  chipset (Ethernet, chipset USB and SATA, all chipset PCIe slots) is one
  group, number 9. A card in a chipset slot could only be passed through
  together with the host's NIC, which is not acceptable. The card has to go in
  the CPU-attached x16 slot (`PCI_E1`, the one nearest the CPU), where it is
  expected to get its own group behind `00:01.1`. To be confirmed once it
  enumerates.
- The premise "the server has the 7570 installed as a secondary GPU" in the
  brief was wrong at the time of inspection; RESEARCH.md §11 updated.

## 2026-10-04 — QEMU 11.1.1 built from source; `mac99` and VFIO checked without the card

**Tried.** `scripts/build-qemu.sh`: QEMU 11.1.1 release tarball (SHA-256
`079ffbff…12482`), targets `ppc-softmmu` and `ppc-linux-user`, `log` trace
backend, built under `third_party/`. Then booted `-M mac99,via=pmu -cpu G4`
with `-nographic` and `auto-boot?=false`.

**Observed.**

- The build takes about two minutes and needs no packages beyond what the
  host already has.
- `vfio-pci` is built into `qemu-system-ppc` on the x86 host, with
  `x-no-mmap`, `romfile` and `x-vga` properties. The four trace events named
  in RESEARCH.md §8 exist under those names.
- OpenBIOS 1.1 (built 2026-06-29) reaches its prompt on serial. `dev
  /pci@f2000000 ls` lists `mac-io@c`, `usb@d`, `QEMU,VGA@e`, `ethernet@f`.
- `hw/ppc/mac_newworld.c` maps the PCI hole at `0x80000000`, as RESEARCH.md
  says.
- The host's OpenSSH 10.5 still offers `diffie-hellman-group1/14-sha1` and
  `ssh-rsa` when asked, so it should be able to talk to Tiger's sshd.

**Concluded.** The harness side of RESEARCH.md §8 holds as far as it can be
checked with no device: cross-architecture VFIO is compiled in and the trace
mechanism is there. Whether a device actually attaches, and what OpenBIOS
does with its BARs, is still open. `scripts/tiger.sh` wraps the guest
lifecycle; only its plumbing has been exercised.

## 2026-10-04 — Card installed: Turks PRO confirmed, memory is GDDR5, VBIOS dumped

**Tried.** After the user installed the card and rebooted: `lspci -nnvv`,
radeon's dmesg, a read-only mmap of BAR2 to read `MC_SEQ_MISC0` and
`CONFIG_MEMSIZE`, and a VBIOS dump through the sysfs `rom` node.

**Observed.**

- `0000:10:00.0` `1002:675d` Turks PRO, subsystem Dell `1028:2b20`, with audio
  function `10:00.1` `1002:aa90`. Behind root port `00:01.1`. The two
  functions are alone in IOMMU group 10. `reset_method` is `bus`.
- The iGPU is still `boot_vga=1` on `amdgpu`; the 7570 is `boot_vga=0`.
- `radeon` auto-loaded about 60 s into boot and bound; `snd_hda_intel` took
  the audio function.
- radeon: "GPU not posted. posting now...". The firmware left the card
  un-POSTed. The ROM holds a single legacy x86 image, no EFI image.
- Memory is GDDR5: the VBIOS board string says `GDDR5 64Mx32`, and
  `MC_SEQ_MISC0` = `0x500026a9` (type nibble 5, the value
  `ni_mc_load_microcode()` tests for). 1024 MB.
- radeon's "RAM width 128bits DDR" line does not distinguish memory types;
  it prints "DDR" for everything.
- Connectors: one DisplayPort, one DVI-I. Both report `disconnected`, no
  EDID.
- Link trained at 2.5 GT/s x4 although card and slot are capable of more.
- VBIOS: 65536 bytes, SHA-256 `591e5d5d…9bf1fb`, part `113-C3340200-101`.
  Details in HARDWARE.md.

**Concluded.**

- The card is Turks, not Redwood: the DCE5 plan stands.
- The brief's assumption of DDR3 is wrong. This is the configuration where
  Linux loads `TURKS_mc.bin`. Whether the memory works after `asic_init`
  without it is now the main open question for milestone 2; Haiku loads no
  microcode on these IDs, so it is not settled either way. The blob cannot be
  in the repository; if it turns out to be required it has to be loaded from
  a file the user supplies.
- A host reboot leaves the card un-POSTed until `radeon` binds. Preventing
  that bind would give a clean cold state, but needs a boot-time change
  (approval required). A secondary bus reset is available and still has to
  be tested as the no-reboot alternative.
- No monitor is detected, so EDID and the modeset part of the reference
  trace are waiting on the user.
- The x4 / 2.5 GT/s link does not matter for modesetting. Noted in case it
  points at a seating or slot problem.

## 2026-10-04 — Monitor EDID; reference trace captured in an x86 guest

**Tried.** With the user's approval: read the EDID through the host's
`radeon`, moved the card to `vfio-pci` (`scripts/card-bind.sh vfio`), and ran
`scripts/x86-trace-guest.sh` until it produced a complete trace.

**Observed.**

- EDID: 256 bytes, both checksums valid, manufacturer `XXX`, name `AAA`,
  2023, digital. Preferred timing 1366x768@59.79 (85.5 MHz); second detailed
  timing 1920x1080@60 (148.5 MHz). The host's radeon chose 1366x768 for
  fbcon.
- Unbinding `radeon` on the host produced two kernel WARNs
  (`irq_domain_remove`, `msi_device_data_release`) and set the W taint. No
  other effect; `vfio-pci` bound normally.
- Guest attempt 1: the initcpio busybox is dynamically linked and has no
  `insmod` or `mount` applets. Fixed by copying its libraries and adding
  `kmod` and `mount` from the host.
- Guest attempt 2: with the card directly on the guest's root bus, radeon
  failed with "Fatal error during GPU init", error -22. The guest kernel had
  logged "Video device with shadowed ROM at [mem 0x000c0000-0x000dffff]" for
  the 7570, so radeon read the emulated VGA's BIOS at 0xc0000 and found no
  ATOM signature. `romfile=` did not help, for the same reason.
- Guest attempt 3: card behind a `pci-bridge`. radeon read the ROM through
  the passed-through ROM BAR, logged "GPU not posted. posting now...", and
  initialised fully. `modetest` then set 1920x1080 and 1366x768.
- Trace: 929 MB raw, of which all but 16 MB is framebuffer aperture writes.
  Details in REFERENCE-TRACE.md.

**Concluded.**

- Milestone 0's criteria are met: ID, memory type, VBIOS, trace.
- A VFIO reset gives the un-POSTed state without rebooting the host. That is
  the recovery method for milestone 2, still to be reproduced outside QEMU.
- Linux does load the MC microcode on this card from cold (6024 words to
  `MC_SEQ_SUP_PGM`). Whether the card works without it remains the open
  question for milestone 2.
- The x86 "shadowed ROM" behaviour is specific to x86 guests and does not
  apply to `mac99`, but it is exactly the failure the pc297 attempt hit:
  taking the VBIOS from the legacy address instead of the ROM BAR.
- After the run the card stays on `vfio-pci`; the monitor shows nothing
  until something drives the card again. A host reboot gives it back to
  `radeon`.

## 2026-10-04 — AtomBIOS interpreter ported; ASIC_Init replays the Linux trace on x86 and big-endian PowerPC

**Tried.**

- `scripts/card-state.py` after the trace guest had exited.
- `scripts/fetch-deps.sh`: Bootlin `powerpc-e300c3` musl toolchain
  (2026.08-1) and a sparse checkout of the Linux radeon sources (commit
  `7704c4c5bb12`) into `third_party/`.
- Copied `atom.c`, `atom.h`, `atom-bits.h`, `atom-names.h`, `atom-types.h`,
  `atombios.h` and `ObjectID.h` (all MIT-headed) into `hw/atom/` and adapted
  them to the OS layer `hw/rdn_os.h` through `hw/atom/atom_port.h`. Register
  callbacks are in `hw/rdn_atom.c`.
- `tests/atom_replay.c`: runs `ASIC_Init` from the VBIOS dump against a mock
  card driven by the reference trace. Each access must be the next one in the
  trace; reads return what the real card returned. Built for x86 and for
  PowerPC, the latter run under `qemu-ppc`.

**Observed.**

- When QEMU exits, the card is left un-POSTed: all CRTCs off,
  `CONFIG_MEMSIZE` 0, `MC_SEQ_SUP_CNTL` 0. `MC_SEQ_MISC0` also reads 0 in
  that state, so the memory type cannot be read from it before `asic_init`.
- First replay attempt matched 1492 accesses and then diverged on an I/O
  port write: the interpreter asked for register 0x2a44 through the I/O BAR,
  and Linux reaches registers beyond the 256-byte BAR through its
  index/data pair at 0/4. With that reproduced in `rdn_atom.c`:
- `make test`: `PASS: asic_init matches trace entries 53..2488 (2436
  accesses), digest 63c4ddd8`, identical on x86 and on PowerPC.
- The 53 accesses before it are Linux's GPU reset check and POST check
  (reads) plus BIOS scratch register setup at 0x172c–0x173c. What follows
  entry 2488 is `evergreen_init_golden_registers` and later the MC
  microcode.
- Turks goes through `evergreen_init()` in Linux, not `ni.c`'s Cayman path;
  only the microcode loader comes from `ni.c`.

**Concluded.**

- The interpreter is correct for the largest table this VBIOS has, and is
  endian-clean: no difference between hosts across 2436 accesses with
  data-dependent control flow.
- The design goal "what is validated without hardware is what runs on
  hardware" holds so far: the same `hw/` objects go into the test and will go
  into the tool and the kext.
- A sysfs reset of the card from the host is still untested, because it
  needs a POSTed card to be meaningful. The bridge `00:01.1` exposes
  `reset_subordinate`, which is the candidate.

## 2026-10-04 — First cold POST of the real card with our code; VRAM works without MC microcode

**Tried.** `rdn_card_post()` (scratch registers, reset check, `ASIC_Init`)
added to the library and to the replay test, then `tools/rdn_tool.c`, a
sysfs front end, run against the driverless card:

    scripts/card-bind.sh none
    sudo build/x86/rdn_tool status
    sudo build/x86/rdn_tool -t traces/ours-post-1.txt post
    sudo build/x86/rdn_tool vramtest
    scripts/card-reset.sh
    sudo build/x86/rdn_tool -n -t traces/ours-post-2-noio.txt post
    sudo build/x86/rdn_tool vramtest

**Observed.**

- Replay test from the very first access: `PASS: post matches trace entries
  0..2488 (2489 accesses), digest 6b51b16f` on x86 and PowerPC.
- First run of the tool read only 4096 bytes of VBIOS: sysfs returns one page
  per read. The ATOM header parsed fine, the tables behind it were zeros. It
  was caught before posting. The tool now loops and checks the image length
  against the size byte in the ROM header.
- Cold POST on the real card: returned 0. Afterwards `CONFIG_MEMSIZE` =
  0x400 (the register is in megabytes: 1024), `MC_SEQ_MISC0` = `0x500026a9`
  (GDDR5), all `CRTC_CONTROL` = `0x00400310`, `MC_SEQ_SUP_CNTL` = 0.
- Our access log against Linux's first 2489 accesses: the same sequence and
  the same written values. The only difference is 170 extra reads of 0x60c
  and 0x61c, polling loops that spin more often when the registers are not
  trapped by QEMU.
- VRAM test through the 256 MB aperture, no MC microcode loaded: 16373 words
  spread over the aperture, written and read back twice (pattern and
  complement), 0 mismatches.
- `reset_subordinate` on root port `00:01.1` puts the card back to
  un-POSTed (`CONFIG_MEMSIZE` 0, `MC_SEQ_MISC0` 0). Wrapped as
  `scripts/card-reset.sh`. POST, reset, POST, reset, POST all behaved the
  same.
- POST with `-n` (no I/O BAR; AtomBIOS indirect I/O through MMIO) also
  succeeds and passes the VRAM test.

**Concluded.**

- Cold POST without x86 code works on this card with our library, in the
  Linux order.
- The MC microcode is not needed for the memory to be usable through the
  aperture: `ASIC_Init` trains the GDDR5 itself. The "no microcode in this
  phase" decision stands. Limits of the evidence: only the first 256 MB of
  the 1024 MB are reachable through the aperture, the test is sparse, and
  nothing has scanned out of that memory yet.
- The I/O BAR is optional, which removes one dependency on OpenBIOS and on
  the G5's Open Firmware.
- The reset method for milestone 2 is settled: `scripts/card-reset.sh`.
- After these runs the card is left posted and driverless, with nothing on
  screen. Next is DDC/EDID and the DCE5 modeset.

## 2026-10-04 — Tiger install media; installer driven through QMP

**Tried.** The user supplied `/srv/files/tiger/MacOSX.4.iso` (SHA-256
`d537b2b9…bf54f8`) and `xcode_2.5_8m2558_developerdvd.dmg` (SHA-256
`c59d5a5c…d9ab2e`). Booted the DVD with `scripts/tiger.sh install` and drove
the installer with `scripts/guest-ctl.py` (QMP screenshots, absolute pointer
through `usb-tablet`, key events).

**Observed.**

- The ISO carries an Apple Partition Map and boots on `mac99,via=pmu -cpu
  G4` to the language chooser in about a minute. Build strings found in the
  image: `8I128` and `8E5`; the exact 10.4.x version is to be read from the
  installed system.
- `qemu-img` cannot open the Xcode `.dmg` ("sector count ... larger than
  max"). `7z x -tdmg` extracts its pieces; concatenating them in order
  (`0.ddm`, partition map, ATAPI driver, `3.hfs`, `4.free`) gives a raw
  image with a partition map, `images/xcode25.img`.
- `usb-tablet` works as an absolute pointer in the Tiger installer, so
  clicks can be scripted at screenshot coordinates.
- Partitioned from the installer's Terminal:
  `diskutil partitionDisk disk0 1 APMFormat "Journaled HFS+" Tiger 31G`.
- Accepted the licence prompt and started an Easy Install on `Tiger`.

**Concluded.** The whole installation can be driven without a VNC client.
No 10.4.11 Combo Update was supplied; whether it is needed depends on the
version this DVD installs and on what Xcode 2.5 requires.

**Licence check.** `r600.c`, `r600_reg.h`, `radeon.h` and `nid.h`, which the
bring-up port drew on, carry the same MIT permission notice as the files
checked earlier and no GPL text.

## 2026-10-04 — Tiger 10.4.6 installed; ssh into the guest; 10.4.11 update started

**Tried.** Let the Easy Install finish, booted from disk, went through the
setup assistant with `guest-ctl.py`, enabled sshd, installed a key.

**Observed.**

- The copy took about 25 minutes under TCG. The installer restarts by
  itself and, because QEMU was started with `-boot d`, comes back up on the
  DVD. QEMU has to be stopped and restarted with `scripts/tiger.sh run`.
- A helper command of mine that ran `pkill -f guest-wait.sh` killed its own
  shell (the pattern matched its own command line). The second QEMU that was
  then started against the same disk was refused by the qcow2 write lock, so
  nothing was damaged. The QMP socket takes one client at a time; while a
  watcher holds it, `guest-ctl.py` cannot connect. The installer QEMU was
  ended with SIGTERM while it sat at the DVD's language screen.
- Snapshot `installed-raw` taken before the first boot.
- First boot: keyboard identification (click OK, press `z`, press `/`),
  region, no transfer, default keyboard, blank Apple ID, Command-Q on the
  registration form then Skip, account `tiger` / password `tiger`, default
  time zone and date.
- `sw_vers`: 10.4.6, build 8I128, Darwin 8.6.0, xnu-792.6.70. OpenSSH
  3.8.1p1.
- sshd: `sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist`.
  Sleep disabled with `pmset`. Key fetched in the guest with `curl` from a
  one-minute web server on the host's loopback (`10.0.2.2` from the guest).
  Tiger's sshd needs an RSA key; it is in `private/ssh/` (git-ignored).
  `scripts/tiger.sh ssh` works. `tiger` has passwordless sudo. Tiger's sudo
  has no `-n` option.
- Apple's Software Update server still serves the 10.4.11 Combined update
  for PowerPC (186 MB) and a Java update. `sudo softwareupdate -i
  MacOSXUpdCombo10.4.11PPC-10.4.11` started in the guest.

**Concluded.** No Combo Update file is needed from the user as long as
Apple's server keeps answering. The guest is reachable over ssh, so the rest
of the setup does not need the GUI.

## 2026-10-04 — 10.4.11 and Xcode 2.5 in the guest; host kernel oops on first Tiger passthrough

**Tried.** Updated the guest to 10.4.11, installed the Xcode 2.5 pieces
needed for kexts, snapshotted, then `scripts/card-bind.sh vfio`,
`scripts/card-reset.sh` and `sudo scripts/tiger.sh passthru 0000:10:00.0`.

**Observed (guest).**

- `softwareupdate -i` in the guest lists the 10.4.11 Combined update but
  never opens a connection to download it. The package URL is in Apple's
  catalog (`http://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/index-1.sucatalog`);
  downloaded on the host from `swcdn.apple.com` (`.tar`, 195368960 bytes,
  SHA-256 `6689b28d…b6d1aa`), copied in over ssh, installed with
  `installer -pkg`.
- Apple's `installer` hangs under QEMU on larger packages: all files are
  written, the log says "Assembling receipt", then the process and its
  `runner` helper sit idle indefinitely. Seen with the Combo update
  (559 MB), `DevSDK.pkg` and `MacOSX10.4.Universal.pkg`; small packages
  finish. Cause unknown. Killing it leaves a stale helper registration and
  the next `installer` dies with "Couldn't register server on this host"
  until the guest is restarted.
- After a restart: 10.4.11, build 8S165, xnu-792.24.17. Snapshot
  `tiger-10.4.11`.
- The real meta-package is `/Volumes/Xcode Tools/Packages/XcodeTools.mpkg`
  (the one at the top of the disc is not usable from the command line).
  Its sub-packages are relocatable: on their own they install to `/`, and
  the meta-package places `DeveloperTools`, `DeveloperToolsCLI`, `gcc4.0`
  and `MacOSX10.4.Universal` under `/Developer`.
- What was done: `DevToolsSystem`, `DeveloperToolsCLI`, `gcc4.0`, `DevSDK`
  and `BSDSDK` with `installer` into `/`; then the four `/Developer`
  packages unpacked directly with
  `cd /Developer && gzip -dc <pkg>/Contents/Archive.pax.gz | sudo pax -r -pe`.
  The `DeveloperTools` postflight only rewrites library paths when the
  folder is not `/Developer`, so it was not run.
- Result: `xcodebuild` runs (DevToolsCore-798.0), gcc 4.0.1 build 5370
  compiles and runs a PPC binary, `Kernel.framework` headers include
  `IOKit/graphics/IOFramebuffer.h` and `IOKit/pci/IOPCIDevice.h`, the
  Kernel Extension project template is present. Snapshot `clean-install`.

**Observed (host).**

- QEMU for the passthrough run never started the guest. The host kernel
  oopsed inside it: "BUG: unable to handle page fault", in
  `native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath`, called from `__pm_runtime_resume` <-
  `irq_chip_pm_get` <- `request_threaded_irq` <-
  `vfio_pci_set_intx_trigger`, i.e. while vfio-pci was setting up the card's
  legacy INTx interrupt. About four minutes later a second oops hit an
  unrelated process (`nmbd`, in `anon_vma_fork`).
- Since then anything that walks `/proc` for all processes (`ps`, `pgrep`)
  blocks and cannot be killed. Plain commands, sudo, dmesg and the
  filesystem still work. The kernel is tainted `D` and `W`.
- A copy of the kernel log is in `build/host-oops-dmesg.txt`.

**Concluded.**

- The host kernel is damaged and has to be rebooted before any more
  hardware work. Rebooting is the user's call.
- Hypothesis, not verified: the stale interrupt state comes from unbinding
  the host's `radeon` earlier in this boot, which logged WARNs in
  `irq_domain_remove` and `msi_device_data_release`. The x86 trace guest ran
  after that unbind without an oops, but it used MSI ("Failed to enable MSI"
  was printed once); `mac99` has no MSI, so this was the first INTx request.
- If the hypothesis is right, the fix is to keep `radeon` from ever binding
  to the card, which needs a boot-time change on the host (approval
  required). If it is wrong, INTx passthrough of this card is broken on its
  own and the guest should be started without the interrupt.
- Milestone 1's passthrough test has not produced any result yet.

## 2026-10-04 — radeon blacklisted on the host

The user chose the blacklist. Wrote `/etc/modprobe.d/osx-gpu.conf`
(`blacklist radeon`). `lsinitcpio` shows the initramfs contains `amdgpu.ko`
but not `radeon.ko`, so no initramfs rebuild is involved. `modprobe -c`
lists the blacklist. Takes effect at the next host boot, which is pending.
To verify after boot: `radeon` not loaded, `0000:10:00.0` without a driver,
card un-POSTed.
