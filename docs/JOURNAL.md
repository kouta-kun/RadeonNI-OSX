Dated log of experiments: what was tried, what was observed, what was
concluded. Negative results are recorded too. Newest entry last.

## 2026-10-04 — Host inventory; the HD 7570 is not on the PCI bus

**Tried.** Read-only inspection of the host (`scripts/host-inventory.sh`
reproduces it): os-release, kernel cmdline and config, `lspci -nnvv`, `lspci
-tv`, IOMMU groups, dmesg, loaded modules, DMI, installed tools.

**Observed.**

- Arch Linux, kernel 6.18.50-2-lts, MSI X370 KRAIT GAMING (MS-7A33), BIOS 1.L8
  (2024-08-30), Ryzen 5 5600G, 27 GiB RAM, 331 GB free on `/`. Uptime 2 days.
- AMD-Vi is enabled with interrupt remapping; 19 IOMMU groups; default domain
  type "Translated". No kernel parameters were needed for that.
- The only display controller is the 5600G's integrated GPU, `30:00.0`
  `1002:1638` (Cezanne), driver `amdgpu`, `boot_vga=1`, IOMMU group 11.
- No device with a Turks or Redwood ID exists. No `1002:aa90`-style HDMI audio
  function either. `radeon` is not loaded.
- The CPU's x16 slot hangs off root port `00:01.1`. That function does not
  respond to config reads (`setpci -s 00:01.1 0.l` selects nothing); only the
  dummy host bridge `00:01.0` is there. On this platform the GPP bridge is
  hidden when no link trained at boot.
- The chipset's downstream ports with nothing behind them (`20:00.0`,
  `20:02.0`, `20:03.0`, `20:04.0`) all report `PresDet-`.
- The DMI slot table is boilerplate (Intel-style bus addresses) and says
  nothing useful.
- Kernel has `CONFIG_MMIOTRACE=y`, `CONFIG_VFIO_PCI=m`, `CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m`,
  `CONFIG_VFIO_NOIOMMU` unset. `TURKS_{mc,me,pfp,smc}.bin.zst` are present in
  `/lib/firmware/radeon`.
- QEMU: only `qemu-base 11.1.1-1` (x86 system emulator and `qemu-img`). No
  `qemu-system-ppc`, no `qemu-ppc` user emulator, no PowerPC cross compiler,
  no clang. Arch's repos have `qemu-system-ppc` and `qemu-user-static`
  11.1.1-4 but no `powerpc-linux-gnu-gcc`.
- No display manager or graphical session; the host is used over ssh. Passwordless
  sudo is available.

**Concluded.**

- The card is not installed, not seated, not powered, or dead. Milestone 0
  cannot start until it enumerates. This needs the user physically, and a
  power-off of the host.
- IOMMU grouping constrains which slot is usable: everything behind the X370
  chipset (Ethernet, chipset USB and SATA, all chipset PCIe slots) is one
  group, number 9. A card in a chipset slot could only be passed through
  together with the host's NIC, which is not acceptable. The card has to go in
  the CPU-attached x16 slot (`PCI_E1`, the one nearest the CPU), where it is
  expected to get its own group behind `00:01.1`. To be confirmed once it
  enumerates.
- The premise "the server has the 7570 installed as a secondary GPU" in the
  brief was wrong at the time of inspection; RESEARCH.md §11 updated.
